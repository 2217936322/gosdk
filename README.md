# gosdk
gosdk is a CS:GO SDK that is currently in development, written in C++17 standard, that empowers users to write CS:GO cheats.

# licensing
gosdk is licensed under the GNU v3 license, to find out more read [this](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/gosdk/blob/master/LICENSE) page.

# information
The formatting method for gosdk is a custom clang-format config that is often either recognized by Visual Studio (tested only on VS19) or usable throughout the CLI by installing a specific binary for it and running the command "clang-format -i (place).(format)"

# contribution guidelines
To contribute to gosdk, you must respect [these](http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/common/hungarian.html) Hungarian notation guidelines, and your code must be written in Pascal Case, if you implement code that isn't yours, it's recommended and asked that you source and credit the creator.

Hungarian notation is to be ignored on classes/structures that explicitly hold VFuncs/general game structures. Hungarian notation is to also be ignored in the Entity/Player header file and interface files.

We recommend you make enums that you add inherit a type. 

Use [CppTripleSlash](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tcbhat.CppTripleSlash-xmldoccommentsforc) to add documentation to your code [if you use Visual Studio 2019], or else, if you cannot, consider writing it by hand or asking someone to contribute to your commit by documenting it. (I, @cristeigabriel, will personally take that job if required)

# why should I use this?
gosdk is aimed towards every developer by being intuitive and trying to reach a good performance in a compact codebase. Besides this, gosdk is also made to compile in very good times by being built around header usage. This, in the long run, assures less time spent on compiling. This can slow down rebuilds, but that is not considered a casual occourence.

# to-do
- Add a menu framework
- Linux support (This Summer)
- General code overlook to maintain consistency and clean-ness
